I want to thank all Americans for pulling together, for coming together, for doing what they have to do. It's been incredible. It's been inspirational. All over the world, they're watching, but all over the world they also have problems. It's in over 120 countries. It's called the invisible enemy, and that's what it is: it's an invisible enemy. But we're doing tremendous work. The truckers, the doctors, the nurses, everybody -- they're just doing tremendously, and, of course, you've heard it a thousand times: wash your hands, good hygiene, all of that. But social distancing, keep away. It's gonna have no place to go, and I just want to thank you. As president, I want to thank you for the incredible job you're all doing. There's spirit in our country like never before. We are really -- we've pulled together as a unit. We've pulled together as a country. We will prevail together. We love the USA.
